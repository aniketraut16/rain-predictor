# rain-predictor
This repository contains my first Machine Learning project: a Rain Predictor. The project involves predicting rainfall based on weather data, focusing on cloud cover and humidity. It includes data gathering, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The primary aim was to gain hands-on experience with the ML workflow.
